# Project Overview: Note App

I developed a **Note App** using **Jetpack Compose**, incorporating several exciting features that enhance user experience and functionality. Below are some key highlights of the project:

## 1. MVVM Architecture
Ensured a clean and testable codebase, promoting better maintainability and scalability.

## 2. Dagger Hilt
Implemented for seamless dependency injection, simplifying the management of app dependencies.

## 3. Room Database
Utilized for efficient local data storage, allowing for quick access and management of notes.

## 4. Swipe to Delete
Facilitated easy management of notes, providing a user-friendly way to remove unwanted entries.

## 5. Robust Repository Pattern
Enhanced data handling capabilities, ensuring a smooth data flow between the UI and data sources.
