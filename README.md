I developed a Note App using Jetpack Compose with several exciting features:
1-MVVM Architecture: Ensured a clean and testable codebase.
2-Dagger Hilt: Implemented for seamless dependency injection.
3-Room Database: Used for efficient local data storage.
4-Swipe to Delete: Facilitated easy management of notes.
5-Robust Repository Pattern: Enhanced data handling capabilities.
